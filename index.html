        <h1> Instructions </h1>
        <p> 
            You are a nearly-blind bee in a quest to capture four flowers for your hive. <br>
            Use a, d, s, and w to control yourself, but be warned. Think fast and smart. <br>
            You can't see very well and will keep flying only until you see a rock or flower, <br>
            and if you don't act quick enough or fly off the screen, <br>
            you will be called back to your hive and lose.
        </p>
